Market-Neutral Strategies in Mid-Cap Portfolio Management: A Data-Driven Approach to Long-Short Equity

This project explores market-neutral strategies in mid-cap portfolio management, focusing on long-short equity techniques tailored for mid-cap stocks. By leveraging financial metrics such as profitability, valuation, and liquidity, we develop a robust framework to maximize risk-adjusted returns while adhering to Point-in-Time (PIT) compliance.

Key Highlights:
Scope: Focused on mid-cap stocks (USD 2 billion to USD 10 billion market cap) from 2013 to 2023.
Objective: To design and backtest factor-based long-short equity strategies for mid-cap portfolios using data-driven approaches.
Data Sources: Financial data from WRDS, ensuring reliability and PIT compliance.
Methodology: Analyze mid-cap stocks using key financial metrics to construct a market-neutral strategy that aims for consistent returns and controlled risk.
Outcome: Highlighting the Sharpe ratio and other performance metrics to validate the strategy's robustness.
Mid-cap companies often offer a sweet spot between the volatility of small-cap stocks and the stability of large-cap stocks, making them ideal candidates for innovative portfolio strategies. Yet, they are frequently overlooked by financial analysts. This study addresses the gap, showcasing how mid-cap stocks can deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns when approached with a disciplined, systematic strategy.
